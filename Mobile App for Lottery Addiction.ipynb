    "### The Scenario (Fictional)\n",
    "A medical institute that aims to **prevent and treat gambling addictions** wants to build a dedicated mobile app to help lottery addicts better estimate their chances of winning. The institute has a team of engineers that will build the app, but they need assistance in the **logical core of the app and how to calculate probabilities**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our Goal\n",
    "For this version of the app, we would focus on the [6/49 lottery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotto_6/49) and build functions that enable users to answer questions like:\n",
    "\n",
    "* What is the probability of winning the big prize with a single ticket?\n",
    "* What is the probability of winning the big prize if we play **40** different tickets (or any other number)?\n",
    "* What is the probability of having at least five (or four, or three, or two) winning numbers on a single ticket?\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Dataset\n",
    "The institute also wants us to consider historical data coming from the [national 6/49 lottery game in Canada](https://www.kaggle.com/datascienceai/lottery-dataset). This data set has data for **`3,665`** drawings, dating from 1982 to 2018.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Import the needed functions\n",
    "We shall need to calculate probabilities and for this we shall need **factorials, permutations** and **combinations**. We shall make use of the Python implementation of these fuctions instead of writing custom functions."
