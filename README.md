# Your-Chances-of-Winning-a-Lottery-Jackpot-is-negligible
No reasonable amount of tickets would increase your chances of winning in a lottery. Stop the addiction!

## The Scenario (Fictional)
A medical institute that aims to prevent and treat gambling addictions wants to build a dedicated mobile app to help lottery addicts better estimate their chances of winning. The institute has a team of engineers that will build the app, but they need assistance in the logical core of the app and how to calculate probabilities.

## Our Goal
For this version of the app, we would focus on the [6/49 lottery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotto_6/49) and build functions that enable users to answer questions like:

* What is the probability of winning the jackpot with a single ticket?
* What is the probability of winning the jackpot if we play multiple different tickets?
* What is the probability of having at least five (or four, or three, or two) matching numbers on a single ticket?

## The Dataset
The institute also wants us to consider historical data coming from the [National 6/49 lottery game in Canada](https://www.kaggle.com/datascienceai/lottery-dataset) and determine the chances of winner with a ticket drawn today. This data set has data for `3,665` drawings, dating from **1982 to 2018**.

**Surprisingly enough, the chances of a ticket drawn today to match a past winning number is very slim!!!**
